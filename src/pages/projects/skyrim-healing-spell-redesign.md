<h2>âœ¨ Shimmering Skyrim Healing Spell</h2>

<p>Skyrim's Healing Spell Redesigned using:</p>
<ul>
  <li> <b>Stacked, stretched, and pitched ride cymbals:</b> Brought to life with volume LFOs.</li>
  <li> <b>Granularly played glass resonant hits:</b> Forming a chord and accompanied by a fire sizzle with multiband volume modulations.</li>
  <li> <b>Pitched hang drum hits:</b> With a lot of reverb, providing lower-frequency support without being too "in your face."</li>
</ul>

<h3>ðŸª” Initial Ignition</h3>
<ul>
  <li> Various lit torch movement sounds</li>
  <li> Rapid cloth movements</li>
  <li> Additional fire sizzle recordings</li>
</ul>
