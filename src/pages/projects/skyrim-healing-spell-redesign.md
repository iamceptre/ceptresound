This Redesign is a part of my 2024 Noisevember, Day 12: Shimmer.
</div><br>
<div>
Skyrim's Healing Spell Redesigned using mainly many stacked stretched and pitched ride cymbals with volume LFOs;<br> Granularlly played glass resonant hits that form a chord and a fire sizzle with many multiband volume modulations.<br>
I used pitched hang drum hits with a lot of reverb to give it some lower-frequency support without being too 'in your face'.
</div>
<div><br>
For the initial ignition, I went for various lit torch movement sounds, rapid cloth movements, and even more fire sizzle recordings.
