<h2>Ouch  ▄︻デ══━一💥</h2>

<p>For Day 13 of Noisevember, I tackled the Sniper Elite 5 Testicle Kill Sound Redesign. This project was especially challenging, as I aimed to make everything sound extremely full and "focused" to amplify the slow-motion effect:</p>
<ul>
  <li>🛫 Heavily processed jet sounds for the bullet time</li>
  <li>🎚️ Lots of moving notch filters </li>
  <li>💥 Warped bullet ricochet and flyby sounds with delays</li>
</ul>

<p>To create the signature "air-ripping-slo-mo-rotating" sound, I stacked multiple choruses (using Valhalla SuperMassive). <br>For the ball crack, I opted for more traditional gore recordings.</p>
