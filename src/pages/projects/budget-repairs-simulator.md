<h2>Budget Repairs Sound Design</h2>

<p>For my job application test for <b>Majster Symulator</b>, I designed a wide range of sounds that bring chaotic DIY home repairs to life. The challenge was to capture the clunky, rough, and sometimes disastrous nature of amateur renovation.</p>
<p>For this project I opted to using only <b>self recorded</b> sounds. (well, about 99%)</p>

<h3>Power Tools & Cutting</h3>
<ul>
  <li>🔩 Placing the drill before drilling</li>
  <li>🔊 Small drill in action</li>
  <li>📦 Taking the drill out of the store</li>
  <li>🛒 Dropping the drill into the cart with other items</li>
  <li>🎚️ Subtle UI sound when browsing drills in the shop</li>
  <li>🪚 Hand saw cutting a door</li>
  <li>✂️ Saw movement before cutting</li>
  <li>💥 Saw falling to the ground</li>
</ul>

<h3>Store Ambiance</h3>
<ul>
  <li>🏬 Construction store ambiance</li>
  <li>🛒 Shopping cart movement</li>
  <li>💲 "Cash register down" sound</li>
</ul>

<h3>Tiles & Breaking Sounds</h3>
<ul>
  <li>🪨 Placing tiles before installation</li>
  <li>📉 Laying down tiles</li>
  <li>❌ Peeling off a tile, dropping, and cracking it on the floor</li>
  <li>🛠️ Taping a tile to the wall (a strong "slap" sound)</li>
</ul>

<h3>Painting & Construction</h3>
<ul>
  <li>🎨 Pouring paint and water into a bucket</li>
  <li>🖌️ Rolling paint onto the wall</li>
  <li>🧱 Placing bricks with UI interaction</li>
  <li>🪟 Placing a window on bricks</li>
  <li>⬇️ Window falling from a height</li>
</ul>

<h3>Falls & Miscellaneous</h3>
<ul>
  <li>💡 Chandelier falling onto a carpet</li>
  <li>🚪 Piece of door falling onto a plastic-covered floor</li>
  <li>📤 Lifting a door</li>
  <li>🚪 Installing a door</li>
  <li>⭐ "Star pop" sound effect and animated text effect</li>
  <li>🏆 Quest completion sound</li>
</ul>
