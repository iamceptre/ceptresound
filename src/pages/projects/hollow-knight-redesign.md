<p>I went pretty emotional on this one and took a different route than the original sound.</p>

<ul>
  <li>I decided to not make any sound for the floating body of "no eyes" to emphasize the feeling of sorrow.</li>
  <li>I tuned all the ambience sounds to the same key as the music to add a dreamy and spiritual feeling.</li>
</ul>
