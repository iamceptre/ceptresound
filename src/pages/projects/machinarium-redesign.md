This Redesign is a part of my 2024 Noisevember, Day 06: Pressure
</div>
<br>
<div>
Every element in today’s redesign is built upon different “pressure" recordings, such as valve pressure air bursts, bus(vehicle) compressors, and soda openings.
I also composed the music using only pipe rubbing sounds with high pressure and chopped valve hisses
