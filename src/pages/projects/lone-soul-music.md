<h2>Ethereal Soundscape</h2>
 
<p>I crafted The <b>Lone Soul</b> main menu theme with an emphasis on <b>atmosphere</b> and <b>mystical tonality</b>:</p>
 
<ul> 
<li>ðŸŽµ <b>Floating Harmonics</b> â€“ A delicate blend of inharmonic metallic sounds working together with musical composition to evoke a sense of mystery.</li>
<li>ðŸ’« <b>Subtle Motion</b> â€“ Slow, undulating modulations to keep the piece engaging and moving.</li>
<li>ðŸ”Š <b>Reverberant Space</b> â€“ Carefully (and quietly) placed <b>heavily revberbrated sounds</b> to enhance the feeling of an endless, abstract space.</li>
</ul>

<p>For this one I've used <b>LABS FREE</b> libraries and <b>FORZO Essentials</b> by: Heavyocity</p>
<p>
<i>This is my Menu Theme Proposition, made for a purpose of a job application.</i>
