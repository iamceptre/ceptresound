  <p>I have always adored the original work by <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/christian-schilling-muyshondt-b728955" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Christian Schilling Muyshondt</a> and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/florian-jensen-f%C3%BCsslin-430a824" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Florian Jensen (Füsslin)</a> from Team <a href="https://www.crytek.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Crytek</a>. Their sound was one of the most significant sparks that inspired me to start experimenting with sound design back in the day.</p>

<h2>What went into this one?</h2>

<h3>🌆 Ambience Design</h3>
<ul>
  <li><b>Children’s Echoes:</b> Heavily reverberated screams and laughter, barely audible, hinting at a lost world in the post-apocalyptic city.</li>
  <li><b>Metallic Scrapes:</b> Band-passed, processed with a long reverb and delay to emphasize the desolate, industrial atmosphere.</li>
  <li><b>Birdsong Layers:</b> A quiet, close-up layer contrasts with a louder, low-passed, reverberated one, evoking a dreamy yet dystopian tone of life persisting. The latter focuses the listener's ears on something far away, creating an interesting yet depressing dissonance, especially when mixed with said Metallic Scrapes.</li>
</ul>

<h3>🎤 Voice Processing</h3>
<p>The Nanosuit voice part was very tough to get right; it required meticulous crafting with interconnected effects:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Very specific Comb filters, narrow-band vocoders, and ring modulation, each effect building on the other.</li>
</ul>
<p>It required countless iterations to balance clarity with the desired mechanical, intelligent, and uncanny voice.</p>

<h3>🎰 Ability-Specific Sound Design</h3>
<ul>
  <li><b>🔍 Nanovision:</b> High-rising sine waves combined with lots of camera shutter recordings.</li>
  <li><b>🌌 Cloak:</b> Delicate, high-pitched glitch sounds paired with processed reversed glass movements, creating a mirror-like, parallax feel.</li>
  <li><b>🛡️ Maximum Armor:</b> Layers of processed rock recordings, processed towards an infamous “mid-rumble” sound, further solidified by heavy parallel saturation.</li>
</ul>
<p>Every Nanosuit function received a distinct sonic identity, unified through a shared processing chain with:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Flangers, choruses, and metallic reverbs on parallel chains maintain cohesion and a recognizable tonal signature while not masking each sound's unique character.</li>
</ul>
