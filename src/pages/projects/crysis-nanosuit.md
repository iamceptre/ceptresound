    I have always adored the original work by <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/christian-schilling-muyshondt-b728955" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Christian Schilling Muyshondt</a> and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/florian-jensen-f%C3%BCsslin-430a824" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Florian Jensen (Füsslin)</a> from Team <a href="https://www.crytek.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Crytek</a>; their sound was one of the most significant sparks designs ever gave me to start experimenting on my sound back in the day.

  <b>What went into this one?</b><br><br>

  <div>
    <b>🌆 Ambience Design:</b><br>
    </div>
    <div>
      <b>- Children’s Echoes:</b> Heavily reverberated screams and laughter, barely audible, hinting at a lost world in the post-apocalyptic city.<br>
    </div>
    <div>
      <b>- Metallic Scrapes:</b> Band-passed, processed with a long reverb and delay to emphasize the desolate, industrial atmosphere.<br>
    </div>
    <div>
      <b>- Birdsong Layers:</b> A quiet, close-up layer contrasts with a louder, low-passed, reverberated one, evoking a dreamy yet dystopian tone of life persisting. The latter focuses the listener's ears on something far away, creating an interesting yet depressing dissonance, especially when mixed with said Metallic Scrapes.<br>
    </div>
  </div><br>

  <div>
    <b>🎤 Voice Processing:</b><br>
 </div>
    <div>
      The Nanosuit voice part was very tough to get right; it required meticulous crafting with interconnected effects:<br>
</div>
      Very specific Comb filters, narrow-band vocoders, and ring modulation, each effect building on the other.<br><br>
</div>
      It required countless iterations to balance clarity with the desired mechanical, intelligent, and uncanny voice.
  </div><br><br>

  <div>
    <b>🎰 Ability-Specific Sound Design:</b><br>
 </div>
    <div>
      <b>🔍 Nanovision:</b> High-rising sine waves combined with lots of camera shutter recordings.<br>
    </div>
    <div>
      <b>🌌 Cloak:</b> Delicate, high-pitched glitch sounds paired with processed reversed glass movements, creating a mirror-like, parallax feel.<br>
    </div>
    <div>
      <b>🛡️ Maximum Armor:</b> Layers of processed rock recordings, processed towards an infamous “mid-rumble” sound, further solidified by heavy parallel saturation.<br>
    </div><br>
 </div>
    <div>
      Every Nanosuit function received a distinct sonic identity, unified through a shared processing chain with:<br>
      Flangers, choruses, and metallic reverbs on parallel chains maintain cohesion and a recognizable tonal signature while not masking each sound's unique character.
