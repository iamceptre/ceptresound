<h2>Magical Soundcraft</h2>

<p>Every element in today’s redesign is built upon carefully synthesized and layered sounds, creating an interesting yet clean and readable soundscape:</p>

<ul>
<li>🔮 <b>Spell Incantation</b> – A tonal blend of <b>three harmonic sine waves</b>, shaped using <b>MUnison</b> from Melda for an ethereal widening effect. Layered with <b>fire ignite</b> and <b>glass crash</b> samples to add texture.</li>
<li>⚔️ <b>Magical Sword Attack</b> – A powerful swing with a fiery <b>sizzle decay</b>, enhanced by a <b>parallel full-wet reverb</b> with <b>granular processing (Pitchloop89)</b> for a creative, otherworldly feeling.</li>
<li>💀 <b>Weighty Enemy Attack</b> – Built around a <b>leather creak recording</b> just before the strike, emphasizing the movement and heaviness of the attack.</li>
<li>🌫️ <b>Ashy Enemy Dissolve</b> – A mystical disintegration effect, shaped with <b>phasers</b> to add a swirling, magical quality.</li>
</ul>

<p>My goal for this one was to make every sound unique and be able to stand out to inform the player about the action without being fatiguing.
<br>
Thus I emphasises mostly the player-centered sounds, making them more powerful and focused.
