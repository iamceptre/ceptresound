This Redesign is a part of my 2024 Noisevember, Day 26: Radical
</div>
<br>
<div>
I went with one of my favourite glory kills from Doom Eternal for today's prompt: Radical.
<br>

For the demon vocalization, I used pitched-down pig recordings layered on top of each other. Both layers are pitched-down, but one of them has its formant on the original pitch; which resulted in nice artifacts that sounded like a throat texture.
</div>

<div>
Also, a little detail I'm happy with here is that the first hit has a subtle crunch layer for the skull break, the second hit is more wet and then, the third has the little eye pop sound, for which I've used a high pitched balloon rub screech recording ending with a pitched-up balloon pop.
