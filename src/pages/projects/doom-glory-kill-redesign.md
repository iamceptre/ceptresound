  <li><b>Pitched-down pig recordings:</b> Two layers were used. Both are pitched down, but one retains its original formant pitch, creating artifacts that resemble breathy throat textures.</li>
</ul>

<h3>ðŸ”¥ Impact and Details</h3>
<ul>
  <li><b>First hit:</b> Includes a subtle crunch layer to emphasize the skull break.</li>
  <li><b>Second hit:</b> Designed to feel more wet, emphasizing the visceral nature.</li>
  <li><b>Third hit:</b> Features an eye pop sound, created using a high-pitched balloon rub screech recording, ending with a pitched-up balloon pop. (eww)</li>
