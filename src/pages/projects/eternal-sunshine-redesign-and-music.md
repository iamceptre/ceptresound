Today, I chose a scene from Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind, giving me the strongest "?!" of all the films.
<br>
<i>(warning: there may be spoilers)</i><br><br>
I had the idea of the piano falling apart more and more, working together with the plot.
<br><br>
The sound also becomes increasingly dense and abstract, whereas, at the beginning, it is pretty believable. In fact, only the car with the train sound is ‘off’, giving a slightly dreamy foreshadowing. In the end, many sounds have a symbolic rather than realistic meaning.
