What went into crafting this piece?
</br>

<div>
🍃Grass & Leaves: Crushing dried foliage, hitting grass with a fist, brushing against a bush and other similar textures like short specific forest wind samples.
<br>
🪵Rotten Wood: Snapping, cracking, hitting and layering pieces of timber to convey the Spriggan wooden body.
<br>
🦊Animal Vocalizations: A mix of fox mating calls and dragon bird cries for otherworldly tones.
<br>
🪈Japanese Flute Samples: Adding a specific vibe and a breathy hi-end texture to Spriggan's voice.

The challenge was transforming raw, dry recordings into something vivid and powerful. Layering and processing were vital, but it was a delicate balance - push too far, and it all starts sounding off and ugly. Finding a sweet spot for every knob took quite some time and patience.
