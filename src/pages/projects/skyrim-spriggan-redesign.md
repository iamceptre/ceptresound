  <p>A Layer Deconstruction of My Spriggan Sound Redesign to give you more insight into how it was made.</p>
</div>

<h2>What went into crafting this piece?</h2>

<h3>🍃 Grass & Leaves</h3>
<ul>
  <li><b>Crushing dried foliage:</b> Hitting grass with a fist, brushing against a bush, and other similar textures like short, specific forest wind samples.</li>
</ul>

<h3>🪵 Rotten Wood</h3>
<ul>
  <li><b>Snapping, cracking, and layering:</b> Hitting pieces of timber to convey the Spriggan's wooden body.</li>
</ul>

<h3>🦊 Animal Vocalizations</h3>
<ul>
  <li><b>Otherworldly tones:</b> A mix of fox mating calls and dragon bird cries.</li>
</ul>

<h3>🪈 Japanese Flute Samples</h3>
<ul>
  <li><b>Breathy hi-end texture:</b> Adding a specific vibe to Spriggan's voice.</li>
</ul>

<p>The challenge was transforming raw, dry recordings into something vivid and powerful. Layering and processing were vital, but it was a delicate balance—push too far, and it all starts sounding off and ugly. Finding a sweet spot for every knob took quite some time and patience.</p>

<p><i>Noisevember</i> is a creative challenge hosted by <a href="https://www.airwiggles.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">airwiggles.com</a>, where participants create and share one sound or piece of audio every day in November.</p>
