140 is a Video Game I developed with my friend's little help, who came up with the initial idea for the game, helped with map design and composed the music.

I tackled the rest of the development, including all the sounds and its implementation.

The whole game was developed in the span of 4 months and the project has met with the approval of those who have played it.
